# Getting Started with Rust WeensyOS

Before beginning work on the assignment (spec is placed inside the `starter-code` folder), follow these 2 steps to configure your Rust compiler.

## Installing Rust and Cargo

If you haven't installed Rust and Cargo yet, run the following command to install them using the official installer:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Dependencies

When building baremetal, we need to setUp correct target architecture to explain `cargo` how to compile the project. In out case WeensyOS is a x86_64 operating system.

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-none
```

Certain features used in the project are unstable (and potentially memory-unsafe), so they must be explicitly enabled.

```bash
rustup default nightly
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only for those who are using a Docker file provided or working locally on your Linux machine, you should disable the locking of `qemu` by manually modifying the `USE_HOST_LOCK=0` flag in GNUMakefile to 0 (line 50). Previously, it prevented two `qemu` processes from running on different Zoo nodes. Otherwise, your environement will not be able to find required variables.

  Congratulations! You're all set up to start working with WeensyOS in Rust!

## How to build

To start WeensyOS, run as usual `make run` or `make run-console`. You should see `PANIC: kernel/c/vm.c:45: assertion 'vmap.pa == addr' failed` error displayed.

## C vs Rust WeensyOS Differences

If you have already reviewed the project structure, you'll notice that the main difference with C-WeensyOS is that the `kern` folder contains both `c` and `rust` implementations. We have separated the bootloader and helper functions (written in C) from the core kernel functions required for this problem setâ€”which are implemented in Rust as a playground. There are only 6 of them: `kernel`, `exception`, `process_setup`, `virtual_memory_map`, `program_load_segment`, and `lookup_l1pagetable`. This is necessary to preserve the original assignment specification, ensuring a fair game for both of the groups. Implementing an OS in a fully memory-safe way would require a somewhat different design approach, making this pset significantly different. However, you will be able to experiment more with memory safety later on for the final project. If you are curious about how to do it the right way, please read this tutorial: https://os.phil-opp.com/.
